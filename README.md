# Life document describing the implementation of well founded semantics in SWI-Prolog

In this document we describe the implementation of tabling based on
delimited continuation and realising the well founded semantics on top
of this implementation.

This is work in progress. Notably the later sections are unclear and do
not represent the evolving implementation accurately.

Comments and pull requests are welcome.
